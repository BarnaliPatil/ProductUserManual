## INTRODUCTION ##

In process control application, sensors are used to measure physical variables such as Level, Temperature, Flow, Pressure, Speed, and Position. Temperature indicators are process control installation instruments that can process signals from temperature sensors and show them on the display.


The TI 7750 is an advanced microcontroller based single channel Process / Temperature Indicator used for monitoring analog signals in the majority of industrial processes.  It can accept mA, mV, Volts, PT100 RTDs and Thermocouple input signals.


Basic input types are selected by on card jumpers and by selecting from the keyboard. Optional single or dual alarm output is provided, alarm type and value are programmable from the front panel keyboard.
